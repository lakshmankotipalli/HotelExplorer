# HotelExplorer

* A Web Application that let's you search Hotels all over the world
* Technologies used : HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Frameworks used : AngularJS 1.6.x

* Angular Features used : Controllers, Service.
(Tried using AngularJS Component, development for the same is still in progress)

* RWD done for first view

* API End points integrated with the Front End

* For Hotel search, search with 'Mumbai' as location, as I have hard-coded the lat and long as same as from API Request Body. Other drop-down options are not giving results as we don't have the genuine lat and long for locations working

* After the search, the search result is shown in the next view
